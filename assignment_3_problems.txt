You will need to import the classicmodels database from mysqlsampledatabase.sql
using MySQL workbench before you start working on this assignment.

For the questions, put your SQL query first and your output second.
For example,

6. Write a PHP program that prints the following information to the terminal:
The customer name, country, and sales rep name on one line per customer.
Order the results by country first and customer name second.
See assignment_3_solution_output.txt for what the output should look like.
assignment_3.php contains most of the code you need to complete the assignment.
You will need to write the SQL query and write the output.
You should use only 1 SQL query to the database.

Problems 1 through 5 are worth 10 points each.
Problem 6 is worth 40 points.
The total number of points for the assignment is 90.

Point breakdown for problem 6:
10 points - 1 SQL query
10 points - correct output format (see assignment_3_solution_output.txt)
 5 points - correct data from the customers table
 5 points - correct data from the employees table
 5 points - order by country first
 5 points - order by customer name second
 
 SQL QUERY: 
SELECT customerName,country,concat(e.lastName ,e.firstName)
FROM customers c Natural Join employees e
